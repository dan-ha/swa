## Single-Page Web Applications

### Main purpose
The purpose of this course is to learn to implement single-page web applications using different technologies and patterns.

### Knowledge
* define dynamic and static languages
* explain the JavaScript object model (including prototype model)
* define functional programming
* identify pitfalls of asynchronous programming
* describe the methods for client/server programming
* describe web sockets
* explain reactive programming
  
  
### Skills
* use object-oriented programming in JavaScript
* use functional programming in JavaScript
* apply common design patterns to document object models
* use callbacks and other higher-order functions for general programming in JavaScript
* apply asynchronous programming using Promises to implement client/server programming
* apply asynchronous programming using XmlHttpRequest to implement client/server programming
* use web sockets to implement client/server communication
* use reactive programming including operators to implement client/server communication

### Competences

* compare methods of object creation
* compare methods of inheritance
* relate functional programming to imperative programming in JavaScript
* compare patterns of GUI programming
* compare use of request/response, web sockets and reactive programming
* <b>design and implement single-page application using JavaScript, web services, asynchronous programming, and client/server communication patterns</b>
